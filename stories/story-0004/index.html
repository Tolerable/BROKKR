      <p>They began arriving during the fourth moon after Brokkr's return.</p>
      <p>First came a lone dwarf from the Eastern caverns, beard tied with copper wire, carrying tools of an apprentice and asking simply: "Is this the forge of Brokkr who walks between realms?"</p>
      <p>A week later, three more appearedâ€”two dwarves and a human smith from Alfheim's border towns. The week after that, an aging giant carrying a seedling in a clay pot, roots wrapped in cooling spells.</p>
      <p>By the turning of the season, a dozen seekers had made camp near the entrance to Brokkr's forge. Some were craftsmen. Others were farmers, healers, even a Vanir poet whose songs called green from stone. All drawn by whispers of the new craftâ€”the joining of forge and seed, the renewal-making.</p>
      <p>Elri watched them from the high windows, her face troubled.</p>
      <p>"They will draw attention," she murmured as Brokkr worked. "From those who would take what you've created."</p>
      <p>Brokkr looked up from the seedling he was shaping, its golden core pulsing between his fingers. "They have already come to take," he said, nodding toward the camp. "But not as thievesâ€”as students."</p>
      <p>"And what will you teach them?" she asked.</p>
      <p>He set down his tools and turned to face her. "What I should have been taught before I was imprisoned." His eyes reflected the forge-fire. "How to carry the flame without being consumed by it."</p>

      <div class="section-title">First Gathering</div>
      <p>Brokkr had never intended to form a council. But on the night of the first frost, when Nostri announced that another dozen seekers had arrivedâ€”including a sap-sage from Vanaheim and a fire-tender from Muspelheim's outer islandsâ€”Brokkr realized that intention mattered less than necessity.</p>
      <p>That evening, he walked to the clearing where the seekers had made their camp. Their faces turned to him, hungry for knowledge, for direction. For meaning.</p>
      <p>He sat by their fire without ceremony, and for a long moment, said nothing. The flames reflected in his forge-eyes, dancing.</p>
      <p>"You've come for secrets," he finally said. His voice held shadows of his captivity, the rasp of volcanic dust. "For craft that can renew what's broken. But know this: what I've learned was not gained easily, nor should it be shared without consideration."</p>
      <p>One of the dwarvesâ€”Grerrik, who had come the longest distanceâ€”leaned forward. "We've brought payment," he said, gesturing to casks of mead, to ingots of rare metal.</p>
      <p>Brokkr shook his head. "Not that kind of consideration. I speak of responsibility. What grows from your hands will touch many lives. The seeds we forge are not mere tools."</p>
      <p>A murmur ran through the gathering. The human smith frowned. "Then what payment do you seek, Master Brokkr?"</p>
      <p>"Commitment," Brokkr replied. "To principles that will guide your craft. To a covenant between maker and what is made." He paused, his gaze sweeping the circle. "Those unwilling to bind themselves thus should leave at first light."</p>
      <p>None left. And in the gray dawn, Brokkr stood before them again and spoke the first principle of what would come to be known as the Forge Council.</p>
      <p>"Maintain dignity in all dealings," he said. "For many watch us, and as our work grows, all realms will turn their eyes to what we create. Each of you stands as representative of this craft. Remember that your actions reflect on all who follow this path."</p>

      <div class="section-title">The Nine Principles</div>
      <p>For nine days, Brokkr spoke one principle each dawn. The seekers gathered in silence as mist rose from the valley, and the seed-smith's words became their foundation.</p>
      <p>On the second day: "Seek out fellowship," he told them. "In isolation, we wither. Together, we find strength. Share your craft, your struggles, your victories. No seed grows alone in the forestâ€”all are connected by root and soil."</p>
      <p>On the third: "Maintain communication with your own. Through words, we weave ourselves together. Through shared knowledge, we grow stronger than any single craftsman could become."</p>
      <p>The fourth principle spoke to diligence: "Be meticulous in all that you do. Half-measures yield half-results, and in this craft, precision matters. When we create life, we cannot afford carelessness."</p>
      <p>The fifth addressed resilience: "Ignore the slander of the ignorant. You will find those who fear what they do not understand, who speak against our craft from ignorance or envy. Let such words pass by like wind. The seed does not argue with the stoneâ€”it simply grows."</p>
      <p>On the sixth day, Brokkr spoke of accountability: "Police yourself, not others. Your path is your own to walk. Guide if asked, but never control. The greatest teacher is example, not command."</p>
      <p>The seventh principle was reliability: "Keep your appointments, honor your word. A promise broken is trust shattered. Trust, once lost, is harder to regrow than the oldest oak."</p>
      <p>The eighth: "Do not overcommit. The eager sapling that spreads roots too quickly often withers come winter. Grow steadily, purposefully. Balance ambition with wisdom."</p>
      <p>On the ninth day, the gathering had swelled to nearly forty seekers. Brokkr climbed atop a stone at the center of the clearing, his eyes bright in the dawn light.</p>
      <p>"Above all," he said, his voice carrying to the farthest tents, "be patient. With yourself, with others, with the craft itself. We work with forces that flow in cycles beyond our reckoning. The seed knows when to sproutâ€”we must learn to trust its wisdom."</p>
      <p>As he finished speaking, something remarkable happened. The clearing, which had been ordinary forest floor, began to shimmer. From the earth where the seekers had gathered each morning, tiny green shoots emergedâ€”a perfect circle of new growth.</p>
      <p>"The land remembers," Brokkr said softly. "As will you."</p>

      <div class="section-title">The First Test</div>
      <p>The day after Brokkr delivered the final principle, a commotion erupted in the camp. Two seekersâ€”Vadim, a human woodcarver, and Rangrig, a stone-dwarf from the western peaksâ€”had come to blows over a shared forge-space.</p>
      <p>Brokkr found them being held apart by their fellows, both bleeding from minor wounds, both shouting accusations.</p>
      <p>"He stole my technique for binding root to stone!" Rangrig bellowed, struggling against those who held him.</p>
      <p>"I discovered it myself!" Vadim countered. "You claim what isn't yours!"</p>
      <p>The gathered seekers looked to Brokkr, expecting judgment or punishment. Instead, the master craftsman sat cross-legged on the ground between the two, pulled out his tools, and began working a small piece of metal.</p>
      <p>Curiosity gradually replaced anger. The fighting stopped as all watched Brokkr's hands shape what appeared to be two identical medallions.</p>
      <p>"The same form," Brokkr said, holding them up, "created independently." He handed one to each of the feuding seekers. "This happens often in craft. When the time is right for an idea to emerge, it may appear in many minds."</p>
      <p>He looked from one to the other. "But the ninth principle speaks of patience. The third of communication. Had either of you shared your discoveries instead of guarding them, this conflict would never have arisen."</p>
      <p>Shame crossed both faces. Rangrig was the first to extend his hand. "I... spoke in haste."</p>
      <p>Vadim clasped it. "As did I."</p>
      <p>Brokkr nodded, satisfied. "Now, show me this technique you both discovered. Perhaps together, we can improve it further."</p>
      <p>The medallions he had given them began to glow softly in their hands, responding to the reconciliation. Later, those medallions would become the first badges of the Forge Councilâ€”symbols of conflict transformed into cooperation.</p>

    <div class="story-section" data-section="5">
      <div class="section-title">Noticed</div>
      <p>Word of the gathering spread beyond the valley. By midwinter, the encampment had become a small village of tents and lean-tos, with over sixty seekers studying under Brokkr's guidance.</p>
      <p>It was inevitable that such a concentration of craft would draw attention.</p>
      <p>The first emissary arrived from Asgardâ€”a minor valkyrie with bronze wings, bearing a formal request from Odin himself: a commission for weapons of renewal that could heal warriors mid-battle. </p>
      <p>Brokkr declined politely. "Our craft serves life, not war," he told the messenger. "Even healing in service of continued fighting twists the purpose of our work."</p>
      <p>The valkyrie departed, baffled by the refusal.</p>
      <p>Three days later, representatives from Alfheim arrived, offering wealth beyond measure for exclusive knowledge of seed-craft. Again, Brokkr refused.</p>
      <p>"Knowledge grows by sharing, not hoarding," he explained. "Those who seek to own what should be free misunderstand the very nature of what we do."</p>
      <p>The third visitor was more troublingâ€”a shadow-walker from Helheim, who came not with offers but warnings.</p>
      <p>"Hela watches your gathering with interest," the specter hissed. "Life-making disrupts death's balance. There will be... consequences."</p>
      <p>That night, Brokkr called the Council together.</p>
      <p>"We are noticed now," he said gravely. "Our work attracts attention from all realms. Some will seek to control us, others to destroy what we build. This is why the first principleâ€”dignity in all dealingsâ€”matters above all others. We must show through our actions that we are neither threat nor tool."</p>
      <p>He looked at the faces around him, no longer mere seekers but something moreâ€”a community formed around shared purpose.</p>
      <p>"From this day forward," he continued, "we are the Forge Council. Not servants of any realm, but stewards of renewal itself."</p>

      <div class="section-title">The Proving</div>
      <p>Spring came early to the valley that year, as if hastened by the seedcraft practiced there. With it came a test none had anticipated.</p>
      <p>It began with whispers among the Council's newest membersâ€”rumors of secret teachings Brokkr shared only with his favorites, of powerful techniques withheld from the majority.</p>
      <p>Led by a silver-tongued Vanir named Fjolnir, a faction formed demanding "equal access to all aspects of the craft." They cornered Brokkr as he returned from gathering materials in the high peaks.</p>
      <p>"We've contributed our knowledge, our resources," Fjolnir said, his followers nodding behind him. "Yet you keep the deepest secrets for a chosen few. This violates your own principles of fellowship and communication."</p>
      <p>Brokkr studied them calmly. "What secrets do you believe I withhold?"</p>
      <p>"The golden-core technique," one called out. "The binding of soul to seed!" said another. "The speaking-with-roots that only your inner circle practices," Fjolnir added, eyes narrowed.</p>
      <p>Instead of denying these accusations, Brokkr did something unexpected. He laughedâ€”a warm, genuine sound that startled the confrontational group.</p>
      <p>"My friends," he said when he'd recovered, "there is no inner circle. No secret techniques I've withheld. The golden core forms naturally when a craftsman achieves harmony between hand and heart. The roots speak to those who learn to listen."</p>
      <p>He looked at each dissenter in turn. "These are not techniques to be taught, but realizations to be earned. Through practice. Through patience." He smiled again. "Through living the principles, not just reciting them."</p>
      <p>Fjolnir wasn't satisfied. "Prove it," he challenged. "Show us this supposed harmony right now."</p>
      <p>Brokkr shook his head. "I will not perform craft as theater, nor will I prove what needs no proving. The sixth principle reminds us: police yourself, not others. Look to your own practice first."</p>
      <p>The group dispersed, some grumbling, others thoughtful. But the next morning, Fjolnir was goneâ€”along with a dozen others who had followed him.</p>
      <p>The Council gathered, concerned about the division. "Should we pursue them?" asked Rangrig. "They may spread false teachings in your name."</p>
      <p>"No," Brokkr said firmly. "The fifth principle: ignore the slander of the ignorant. What we build here must stand on its own merit, not on control of others' words or actions."</p>
      <p>He looked around at those who remainedâ€”fewer now, but somehow stronger in their commitment.</p>
      <p>"This is the nature of true learning," he said. "Not all seeds take root. Not all who come are ready to grow."</p>

      <div class="section-title">Legacy</div>
      <p>Years passed. The makeshift camp evolved into a permanent settlementâ€”the Forge Haven, they called it. Workshops and gardens spread through the valley, each specializing in different aspects of seedcraft.</p>
      <p>Brokkr watched it grow with quiet satisfaction, gradually stepping back from daily leadership. The Council now governed itself through consensus, guided by the nine principles that had become their foundation.</p>
      <p>On the fifth anniversary of the Council's founding, Brokkr called a gathering in the original clearingâ€”now a circular garden where rare plants from all Nine Realms grew together in harmony.</p>
      <p>"I've been asked why we call ourselves the Forge Council when we work primarily with seeds and growth," he began, his voice weathered but strong. "The answer is simple: because we forge more than metal. We forge connectionsâ€”between realms, between species, between past and future."</p>
      <p>He gestured to the diverse faces around himâ€”dwarves and humans, elves and giants, even a few Aesir who had set aside their warrior pride to learn renewal-craft.</p>
      <p>"What we've built here is greater than any single creation. It is a community that will outlast us all."</p>
      <p>From a pouch at his belt, he produced nine seedsâ€”each glowing with inner light, each unique in form.</p>
      <p>"These are the Nine Seeds of Principle," he explained. "Each embodies one of our founding teachings. I will entrust them to nine among you, chosen not for skill or seniority, but for how deeply you've integrated these principles into your life and work."</p>
      <p>One by one, he called forth nine Council membersâ€”some veterans, some relatively new. To each, he gave a seed and a quiet word of wisdom meant for them alone.</p>
      <p>When the ninth seed had been bestowed, Brokkr stepped to the center of the garden.</p>
      <p>"I journey now to the deeper forge," he announced. "There is work I must complete aloneâ€”a seed that may one day restore what was thought forever lost."</p>
      <p>Murmurs rippled through the gathering. Some protestedâ€”they still needed his guidance, his wisdom.</p>
      <p>Brokkr shook his head, smiling. "You have all you need already. The principles live in you now, not in me."</p>
      <p>He raised his hands, and throughout the valley, every seed and plant crafted by the Council began to glow faintlyâ€”a web of light connecting all they had created.</p>
      <p>"Remember always: we forge not for power, not for wealth, not even for knowledge alone. We forge for renewal. For the mending of what is broken. For the greening of barren places."</p>
      <p>He looked across their faces one last time. "In a world hungry for destruction, we choose creation. In realms obsessed with endings, we cultivate beginnings. This is our craft. This is our covenant."</p>
      <p>The next morning, Brokkr was goneâ€”but the Council remained, guided by nine principles and nine seeds of living light. And in gardens throughout the Nine Realms, their work took root and flourished.</p>
