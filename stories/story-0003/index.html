      <p>Before he was Brokkr the Seed-Maker, he was simply Brokkrâ€”young, bold, but not yet great.</p>
      <p>There is a vault in Svartalfheim called the Deephold. No dwarf speaks of it directly. They name it sidewaysâ€”the Keeper's Shelf, the Under-Treasury. Within it lies the most precious materials in the Nine Realms: Eitr-crystal. Root-alloy from Yggdrasil's first growth. Seedstone that remembers the shape of lost worlds.</p>
      <p>These were the treasures Brokkr coveted, not for wealth, but for what they might become in skilled hands.</p>
      <p>"I require access to the Deephold," he announced to the Council of Smiths, his voice too loud for the stone chamber, his beard too short for such boldness.</p>
      <p>The eldest smith, Alfgrim Steelbraid, studied him for a long moment. "No."</p>
      <p>Brokkr's fists clenched. "I have designs that wouldâ€”"</p>
      <p>"You have ambition," Alfgrim interrupted. "For the Deephold, you need worthiness. Prove it."</p>
      <p>The challenge was made. The terms simple: forge something the gods themselves would envy. Then, perhaps, the vault would open.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Captivity</div>
      <p>The Jotuns of Muspelheim had long warred with the dwarves over the secret of root-forging. So when they captured a young dwarf smith sneaking into their realm for fire-seeds, they didn't kill him. They imprisoned him.</p>
      <p>Brokkr's cell was carved from obsidian, spelled to resist his craft. No tools. No forge. No raw materials save the volcanic dust that settled through the single, high window.</p>
      <p>"Sixty seasons," rumbled the Jotun jailor, Surtrson the Merciless. "For trespass. For theft-attempt. For arrogance."</p>
      <p>Brokkr sat in the dark, measuring his breaths. Sixty seasons. Fifteen years of his craft lost.</p>
      <p>The first year, he raged. Beat his fists against the walls until they bled. The second year, he broke. Lay on the stone floor and counted cracks in the ceiling. The third year, he wept, realizing none would come for himâ€”he'd told no one of his quest.</p>
      <p>The fourth year, he began to think.</p>
      <p>He approached his prison as a puzzle. A forge is simply tools and materials and knowledge. So what might this cell contain?</p>
      <p>Slowly, Brokkr began to collect: Dust. Hair from his own beard. Mineral deposits from water that seeped through cracks. Once a month, Surtrson brought him gruel in a wooden bowl, and if Brokkr was careful, he could scrape tiny splinters free.</p>
      <p>He practiced. Instead of counting days, he counted skills.</p>

    <div class="story-section" data-section="3">
      <div class="section-title">Education</div>
      <p>A curious thing happened in the seventh year. Surtrson began to talk.</p>
      <p>At first, short grunts. Then questions. Why would a dwarf risk death for fire-seeds? What knowledge did the stone-diggers have that giants lacked?</p>
      <p>Brokkr, starved for conversation, answered carefully. Then he began to ask his own questions.</p>
      <p>"Your people shape fire like we shape metal. How?"</p>
      <p>Surtrson laughed. "Questions earn no answers, Dwarf."</p>
      <p>"I will trade," Brokkr countered. "Knowledge for knowledge."</p>
      <p>The giant considered this. "What knowledge does a prisoner hold?"</p>
      <p>"The secret of quenching soulsteel so it remembers its heat."</p>
      <p>Surtrson's eyes widened. This was dwarf-lore no giant had ever learned.</p>
      <p>So began Brokkr's education. For each secret he shared, Surtrson brought knowledge in returnâ€”and books. Ancient texts on fire-shaping, on seed-growing, on the binding of elements to will. Grudgingly at first, then with growing interest, the jailor brought scholars.</p>
      <p>Brokkr's cell became a strange sort of workshop. No forge, but a mind sharpening itself on knowledge no other dwarf had sought.</p>
      <p>In the tenth year, Brokkr made his first creation: a glowing ember from volcanic dust and his own blood that never died, never consumed its fuel. He presented it to Surtrson not as tribute, but as proof.</p>
      <p>Proof that there was something new to be learned here.</p>

    <div class="story-section" data-section="4">
      <div class="section-title">Vision</div>
      <p>The twelfth year brought a visitorâ€”a woman tall and terrible, her skin like polished basalt, her eyes twin furnaces. Sinmara, wife of Surtr, ruler of Muspelheim.</p>
      <p>"My husband's cousin speaks highly of you, dwarf. Too highly. He says you craft with nothing. Make growth from barrenness."</p>
      <p>Brokkr bowed, hiding the fear that skittered along his spine. "I merely study, queen of flames."</p>
      <p>He hesitated, then retrieved his most precious creation from its hiding place beneath a loose stone. A seed, no larger than his thumbnail, crafted from splinters and dust and tears.</p>
      <p>Its surface swirled with patterns that changed as one watchedâ€”roots becoming flames becoming roots again. It hummed with a sound like distant voices calling.</p>
      <p>Sinmara's eyes narrowed. "What does it make, when planted?"</p>
      <p>Brokkr chose his words carefully. "It doesn't 'make' anything, great queen. It... remembers. If planted in ash, it will grow what once grew there, before the ash."</p>
      <p>"Renewal," she whispered, understanding instantly.</p>
      <p>"A trifle," Brokkr said. "A curiosity only."</p>
      <p>But her eyes saw deeper. "If one could forge not just weapons, not just tools, but life itself..." She looked at him with new respect. "You could have escaped years ago with this."</p>
      <p>"And go where?" Brokkr asked simply. "Here, I learn."</p>
      <p>She laughed then, heat shimmering around her. "Surtrson was right. You are dangerous in a way my people never anticipated."</p>

      <div class="section-title">Bargain</div>
      <p>Word spread through Muspelheim. The prisoner who taught rather than broke. The dwarf who created without tools.</p>
      <p>Surtr himself came in the fourteenth year, his body a walking conflagration, the stone corridor melting where he passed.</p>
      <p>"One year remains of your sentence," he said, voice like coal splitting. "You could leave then, return to your kind."</p>
      <p>Brokkr nodded, saying nothing.</p>
      <p>"The Aesir and Vanir come soon for the fire-treaty renewal," Surtr continued. "Thor, Tyr, Freyja... perhaps Odin himself." His burning eyes fixed on Brokkr. "They will want assurances of our strength. Demonstrations."</p>
      <p>Brokkr understood. Surtr hadn't come to talk about release. He'd come for a commission.</p>
      <p>"What would you have me craft, lord of Muspelheim?"</p>
      <p>"Something they will remember," Surtr said. "Something that reminds them why they fear us."</p>
      <p>Brokkr took a deep breath. Here was opportunity wrapped in flame.</p>
      <p>"I will craft something never seen in the Nine Realms," he said. "But my price is high."</p>
      <p>"Name it." Surtr uttered a little too quickly.</p>
      <p>"Freedom before the season ends. Safe passage to any realm I choose. And..."</p>
      <p>Surtr waited.</p>
      <p>"Apprentices," Brokkr said. "I will share what I've learned. The new craft I've discoveredâ€”the joining of seed and forge. It belongs to no realm yet. It could belong to Muspelheim and Svartalfheim both."</p>
      <p>The fire giant's face was impossible to read through the flames, but when he spoke, there was something like respect in his voice.</p>
      <p>"Begin your work, seed-smith. Show us what you've become in darkness."</p>

      <div class="section-title">Emergence</div>
      <p>They gave him a forge then, a proper one carved into the volcano's heart. Materials he'd only dreamed of: magma crystals, phoenix down, the molten ore of dying stars.</p>
      <p>What Brokkr created was not a weapon, though Surtr had clearly expected one. Not armor, not a tool of war or domination.</p>
      <p>He forged a tree.</p>
      <p>Small enough to hold in two hands, its trunk gleaming silver-black, its branches spreading in perfect symmetry. The leaves were thin sheets of hammered gold that chimed like bells when touched, each inscribed with runes so small they could only be read with a whisperstone.</p>
      <p>Its roots curled around a sphere of polished obsidian in which flames moved like living things.</p>
      <p>"What trick is this?" Surtr demanded when presented with it. "You were to craft something to inspire fear."</p>
      <p>"Touch it," Brokkr said quietly.</p>
      <p>When Surtr did, the tree transformed. Its branches extended, flowing like liquid metal, reshaping themselves into an exact replica of Gungnirâ€”Odin's legendary spear. Another touch: the tree became MjÃ¶lnir, then Laevateinn, then weapons not yet forged in any realm.</p>
      <p>"It remembers the shape of things," Brokkr explained. "Not just what is, but what could be. What might be needed."</p>
      <p>Understanding dawned in Surtr's burning eyes. This was worth a hundred conventional weapons. A thousand.</p>
      <p>"And if it were larger?" the fire lord asked.</p>
      <p>"With the right materials, it could grow to the size of Yggdrasil itself," Brokkr replied. "But that craft is yet beyond me. I would need... certain materials from the Deephold of Svartalfheim."</p>
      <p>Surtr nodded slowly. "You will have them."</p>

      <div class="section-title">Recognition</div>
      <p>The gods came to Muspelheim as they did each century, wary and watchful. Odin All-Father, Thor Thunderer, Freyja of the Vanir, and othersâ€”their power dampened by ancient treaty while on giant soil.</p>
      <p>They did not expect to find a dwarf seated at Surtr's right hand.</p>
      <p>"What prisoner is this?" Thor demanded, hand instinctively seeking MjÃ¶lnir.</p>
      <p>"No prisoner," Surtr corrected. "Brokkr Seed-Smith, Master Craftsman of Two Realms."</p>
      <p>Odin's single eye fixed on Brokkr, seeing more than mere appearance. "You bear a strange craft upon you, dwarf. Neither wholly of stone nor wholly of fire."</p>
      <p>Brokkr stood, bowing with precise respectâ€”neither servile nor proud. "I have found the space between, All-Father. Where seed meets forge, where renewal meets creation."</p>
      <p>When he presented his creationâ€”now grown to the height of a man, its branches forming and reforming into endless possibilitiesâ€”even the gods fell silent.</p>
      <p>Freyja approached it first, her fingers tracing the runes on a golden leaf. "This speaks of Vanir wisdom, yet shaped by dwarf hands through giant fire," she murmured. "Three realms in one making."</p>
      <p>Odin nodded slowly. "I would have such craft in Asgard."</p>
      <p>"And you shall," Surtr said. "For the tree-smith returns with us to Svartalfheim, as agreed. But he will travel the realms freely now, bound to no single forge."</p>
      <p>The treaty renewed, the gods departedâ€”but not before Odin spoke privately to Brokkr.</p>
      <p>"There will come a time, Seed-Smith, when the realms need more than weapons. When what is broken requires not destruction, but rebirth."</p>
      <p>Brokkr nodded. "I will be ready, All-Father."</p>
      <p>And so he returned to the Council of Smiths, no longer young, no longer merely bold. The Deephold opened to him without questionâ€”for what use are locks against one who has mastered the craft of becoming?</p>
      <p>From captivity had come wisdom. From limitation, innovation. From darkness, a light that would one day save the Nine Realms themselves.</p>
